# ABN — Chat History (Jacob + Claude)
This file is updated when Jacob asks Claude to update it.

## 2026-05-24 — Batch 2 — Settings + activity log
- Confirmed engineering rule #1 with two greps (`AgentSettings|AgentOverrides|TenantSettings|UserPreference|NotificationSetting` in `database/models.py`; `agent_settings|tenant_settings|user_preferences` in `api/routes/`). Both empty — nothing to duplicate.
- Added three SQLAlchemy models (AgentSettings, TenantSettings, AgentActivityLog) and Alembic revision `d7e2f9b1c3a4`.
- Decided override semantics for AgentSettings: when a row exists it wins; otherwise defaults derive from `Agent.blueprint` so `GET /settings` is never empty. Existing pause/resume endpoints continue to write `Agent.enabled` directly so legacy callers stay green.
- Added single-source helper `agent_runtime/activity_log.py` with idempotent upsert keyed on (agent_id, run_id, event_type). Wired into `OPERARunner._save_run_record` so every OPERA run appends one `run_completed` row.
- New endpoints: `GET/PUT /api/agents/{id}/settings`, `GET /api/agents/{id}/activity`, `GET/PUT /api/tenant/settings`. Validation: `notify_on` and `output_formats` are enum-checked; `threshold_pct` must be in (0, 100]; `updated_by` is required on every agent-settings PUT.
- Asserted in test that PUT /settings does NOT regenerate the blueprint — the signed `Agent.signature` is unchanged after the call.
- Full backend suite: 982 passed (962 baseline + 20 new). No regressions.

## 2026-05-24 — Level 4 chat
- Confirmed backend V1 complete (939 baseline tests; 962 after Batch 1)
- Confirmed Tauri dashboard live (`ABN_1.0.0_x64-setup.exe`, 77.6 MB)
- Confirmed landing 33 pages on Vercel (`/`, 3 layer pages, 5 solution pages, 5 company pages, `/api`, `/transparency`, `/pricing`, `/changelog`, `/status`, `/legal` + 8 legal subpages, 3 auth routes, `/solutions` hub, `/_not-found`)
- Found `frontend/src/pages/AgentDetailPage.tsx` built but not fully hydrated by backend
- Found `Finding` model missing from DB — `AgentRun.output` JSON was the only carrier for findings (no stable id, no per-finding query)
- **Batch 1 started + completed** in same session: Finding model + Alembic migration + persistence helper + 3 new API endpoints + extended `GET /api/agents/{id}` + 23 new tests. All 962 tests green.
- Locked in 8 engineering rules in CLAUDE.md (`## Engineering rules`): grep-first, one source of truth, English-only in code, document the flow, CLAUDE.md is persistent memory, Anthropic-grade safety, idempotency for everything that writes, tests cover the contract.
- Created `JACOB_SESSION.md` + `CHAT_LOG.md` for permanent session memory readable from a fresh chat via the GitHub raw URL.
